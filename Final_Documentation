Grantit Consulting Services MySQL Database
Project team: Bryan Weber, Tony, Ray

Platform: MYSQL
database: gctest
table: Clients

Clients table needed columns
  1. id
  2. first_name
  3. last_name
  4. city
  5. state
  6. postal_code
  7. email
  8. phone
  
  Step 1
  Used documentation from previous experience to create the script in a 
  docker container using the cat command and a text editor outside of the
  container
  
  Step 2
  Once checked for syntax errors the script was run in the container to 
  create the table and populate it with test data
  
  Step 3
  Unexpected error occured, looking over script for problems. Ended up
  being a simple missed semicolon at the end of the scipt
  
  Step 4
  Script now runs successfully and the database and table are now 
  fully operational in the container
  
  Step 5
  Backup of the database, both full and schema only, have been made and
  the project is complete!
